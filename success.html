        <h1>Riddleton Family Treasure</h1>
        <p>
            This is Alexander Riddleton. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are reading this, you have found the coordinates of the Riddleton Family treasure on Alfred Faure Island. Our family has a long history of puzzlemaking and traversing the globe for bounty, so it only seemed appropriate to hide our family's gatherings under a series of puzzles.

        <p>
            The future of this legacy is now in your hands. You may unearth the treasure and reap its benefits or contribute to its collection more goods from which our future generations can prosper. I will leave that up to you. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For now, Bon Voyage. I wish you well on your adventure.
